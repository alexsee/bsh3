      RemotingLite
      ------
      A light framework for making remote method invocations using TCP/IP. It is based loosely on
      Windows Communication Foundation, and is meant to provide programmers with the same API
      regardless of whether they write software for the Microsoft .NET platform or the Mono .NET
      platform.
      Consult the documentation and example applications for information about how to use this API.
